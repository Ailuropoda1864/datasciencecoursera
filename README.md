The script `run_analysis.R` does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

How to use the script `run_analysis.R`:
1. Download the data for the project here: [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
2. Unzip the downloaded file and note the directory in which the unzipped files are saved.
3. Change `data.dir` in `run_analysis.R` to the directory noted in Step 2.
4. Run the whole script; a tidy dateset named `tidy_data.txt` will be created.
